        <div style="background: #e8f5e8; border: 3px solid #27ae60; border-radius: 10px; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
            <h2 style="color: #27ae60; margin: 0 0 15px 0;">üìã COACHING TAKEAWAYS</h2>
            <div style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8;">
                <p><strong>üéØ WHAT ARE 10M FLY TIMES?</strong><br>
                During the 40m sprints, use your stopwatch to time just the middle 10m section (from the 20m mark to the 30m mark). This shows their top speed without the acceleration phase.</p>
                
                <p><strong>‚è±Ô∏è HOW TO TIME:</strong><br>
                1. Set up markers at 20m and 30m<br>
                2. Start timing when they hit the 20m mark<br>
                3. Stop timing when they hit the 30m mark<br>
                4. Record this time - this is their "10m fly"</p>
                
                <p><strong>üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è WHAT IS BOUNDING?</strong><br>
                Bounding = big jumping steps focusing on distance, not height. Think "leap, leap, leap" like a kangaroo. Each "bound" should cover the distance shown (e.g., 2.4m = each jump covers 2.4 meters).</p>
                
                <p><strong>üìè HOW TO SET UP BOUNDING:</strong><br>
                1. Use a tape measure to mark out 7 cones at the spacing shown<br>
                2. Athlete bounds from cone to cone (7 bounds total)<br>
                3. Then sprints 25m to finish<br>
                4. Rest well between attempts</p>
                
                <p><strong>üìû EMERGENCY CONTACT:</strong><br>
                If you're unsure about anything, call the athletes' parents/guardians listed in each session.</p>
                
                <p><strong>üó£Ô∏è COACHING CUES & COMMUNICATION:</strong><br>
                ‚Ä¢ <strong>OVER-COMMUNICATE:</strong> Explain everything multiple times - once is never enough!<br>
                ‚Ä¢ <strong>Between each rep:</strong> Tell athlete what they did well and what to improve<br>
                ‚Ä¢ <strong>Don't rush:</strong> Let athlete analyze themselves first, then add your feedback<br>
                ‚Ä¢ <strong>Key cue for sprints:</strong> "Drive your foot down aggressively throughout the run!"<br>
                ‚Ä¢ <strong>Warm-up is crucial:</strong> Explain every exercise and why they're doing it<br>
                ‚Ä¢ <strong>Ask questions:</strong> "How did that feel?" "What can we improve?"</p>
                
                <p><strong>‚è∞ SESSION DURATION:</strong><br>
                Each training session is designed to run approximately <strong>70-75 minutes</strong> total.</p>
